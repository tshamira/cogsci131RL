# cogsci131RL
This project was done for the course Cognitive Science 131: Computational Models of the Mind, taught at UC Berkeley in Fall 2022 by Professor Ramirez-Latorre.
The task was to implement rules for a two-dimensional "Pac-Man" game where an agent (the 2-D "Pac-man" player) had the choice to move up, down, left, or right within a grid consisting of seven squares. The squares were arranged so that five squares were along a vertical line, and the remaining two squares were to the left and right of the middle square - the end grid resembled a cross. 
Each square on the grid was given a "state" and a "reward" - the state of the grid was a simple number from 0 to 11, representing the placement of our agent, and the reward was a number ranging from -1.0 to +1.0, representing the amount of points that our agent would receive after traveling through that square.
